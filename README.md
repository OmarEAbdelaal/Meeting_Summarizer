# Meeting_Summarizer
AI Project to Build a Meeting Summarizer with Whisper and Deepseek
## **Business Overview**:

This project aims to create an AI-powered meeting summarization tool that addresses the growing need for organizations to efficiently manage, analyze, and derive actionable insights from meetings. In todayâ€™s fast-paced business environment, meetings are pivotal in driving decisions, setting priorities, and strategizing for the future. However, capturing and retaining the essence of lengthy discussions, identifying critical action items, and tracking the overall tone of conversations can be daunting, often leading to missed opportunities or incomplete follow-ups. This tool is designed to alleviate these challenges by automating the transcription, analysis, and summarization of meeting content, providing stakeholders with clear, concise, and actionable outputs.
